Becoming a Reviewer
===================
Anybody who is member of the dsd@acpica.org mailing list can act
as a reviewer.  Approving of a proposal is indicated by providing
a "Reviewed-by:" tag in an email reply; e.g.:

   Reviewed-by: Some Person <fancy.address@someplace.org>


Becoming a Maintainer
=====================
_DSD maintainership is a meritocracy. The process is:

   1. A contributor submits a request to dsd@acpica.org and asks to
      become a maintainer.

   2. Existing maintainers examine the merit of the request based on
      the track record of the individual making the request, considering
      several factors:
   
      2.1 OS vendors (e.g., FreeBSD, Red Hat, or Microsoft) may propose
          a maintainer.

      2.2 Existing firmware representation technologies: i.e., the person
          is a known ACPI contributor or Device Tree contributor or 
	  maintainer.

      2.3 Any past experience with the dsd@acpica.org mailing list and
          its membership.

   3. Based on their examination, the existing maintainers will reach a
      decision and inform the requestor.
