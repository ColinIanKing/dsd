Formal Language for Describing Device Properties
------------------------------------------------
The formalism used to describe device properties is basic YAML format, and
the standard rules for YAML apply:

   -- spaces *must* be used for indenting (no tabs)
   -- indentation implies structure
   -- comments start with '#' and go to the end of the line
   -- the string '---' separates documents; a file with no '---' is considered
      one document, and a file may contain multiple documents

The dsd command provided in the tools directory of this source tree recognizes
two different document types:

   -- a device property description, where the first key-value pair used
      must be 'property: <name>'

   -- a device description, where the first key-value pair used must be
      'device: <name>

These objects must refer to one another; i.e., a device property must be
used by one or more devices, and a device must use one or more device
properties (use the 'dsd verify db' command).

Device Property Keywords
------------------------
Apart from the 'property: <name>' being required as the very first key-value
pair in the YAML document, the remainder of the keywords recognized for a
device property may occur in any order.  The dsd command currently recognizes
the following keywords:

	# the device property being desribed...
	property:	<name>

	# the maintainer of the description...
	owner:		<string>

	# the value type; this list is the current allowed list of types and
	# is probably not sufficient -- more are easily added
	type:		integer |
			hexadecimal-integer |		# 0xC or just C
			hexadecimal-address-package |	# 6-byte MAC address
			string |
			<type> <value-list>

	# where the device property is used, why, and what it does
	description:	<free text>

	# an example of using the device property; more than one, if possible
	example:	<free text>

	# a list of the devices that use this device property
	devices:	<device-name-list>

where <value-list> must look like:

	values:
		- token:	<string>	# a value one may use
		  description	<string>	# what the value means
		- ...

and the <device-name-list> must look like:

	devices:
		- <device-name>		# a device using this property
		- ...

For example:

property:       phy-mode
owner:          Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com>
devices:
	- generic-nic
type:           string
values:
        - token:        na
          description:  none available
        - token:        mii
          description:  media independent interface (MII)
        - token:        gmii
          description:  gigabit MII
        - token:        sgmii
          description:  serial gigabit MII
        - token:        tbi
          description:  ten bit interface
        - token:        revmii
          description:  reverse MII
        - token:        rmii
          description:  reduced MII
        - token:        rgmii
          description:  reduced gigabit MII (RGMII)
        - token:        rgmii-id
          description:  RGMII with internal delay
        - token:        rgmii-rxid
          description:  RGMII with receive delay only
        - token:        rgmii-txid
          description:  RGMII with transmit delay only
        - token:        rtbi
          description:  reduced ten bit interface
        - token:        smii
          description:  serial MII
        - token:        xgmii
          description:  10 gigabit MII
        - token:        moca
          description:  multimedia over coax
        - token:        qsgmii
          description:  quad serial gigabit MII
description: |
        Defines the PHY mode to be used for this device.
example: |
        Package (2) { "phy-mode", "xgmii" }


Device Keywords
---------------
Apart from the 'device: <name>' being required as the very first key-value
pair in the YAML document, the remainder of the keywords recognized for a
device may occur in any order.  The dsd command currently recognizes the
following keywords:

	# the device being desribed...
	device:		<name>

	# the maintainer of the description...
	owner:		<string>

	# a simple description of what the device is
	description:	<free text>

	# a list of the device properties that this device uses
	properties:	<property-name-list>

where the <property-name-list> must look like:

	property:
		- <device-property-name>  # a property this device uses
		- ...

For example:

device:         generic-nic
description:    general use network interface card
owner:          Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com>
properties:
   - phy-mode
   - phy-channel
   - mac-address
