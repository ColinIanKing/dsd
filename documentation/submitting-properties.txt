Submitting Device Property Definitions
======================================
If you wish to have a device property definition included in the database
of known definitions, please email the proposed definition to dsd@acpica.org.

The emailed proposal will then be subject to review by any and all reviewers
and maintainers responsible for maintaining the database.  If the maintainers
agree that the proposal is sufficient, they will provide "Acked-by:" replies
and incorporate the new definition into the database.

Proposals must be submitted in one of two formats:

   1) A complete formal definition of a new device property (please see
      the file documentation/language.txt for all the details of the formal
      language to use), or

   2) A patch (using "diff -Naur") to an existing device property.  The
      database is formatted in such a way to make this possible.

In either case, please describe what the proposal is for, and why it
is needed.

All proposals submitted must contain a "Signed-off-by:" as part of the
commentary describing the proposal.  This is described by the following
excerpt from the Linux kernel documenation; we will follow the same
basic rules:

   The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
   patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
   pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
   can certify the below:
   
           Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
   
           By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
   
           (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
               have the right to submit it under the open source license
               indicated in the file; or
   
           (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
               of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
               license and I have the right under that license to submit that
               work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
               by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
               permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
               in the file; or
   
           (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
               person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
               it.
   
           (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
               are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
               personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
               maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
               this project or the open source license(s) involved.
   
   then you just add a line saying
   
   	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
   
   using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
